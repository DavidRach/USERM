\title{Estimate Cosine Similarity Matrix for Fluorochromes}
\usage{
EstimateSimilarityMtx(Userm)
}
\arguments{
\item{Userm}{A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{detectors}: A character vector of detector names to be used as rows.
\item \code{fluors}: A character vector of fluorochrome names to be used as columns.
\item \code{A}: A numeric matrix with rows representing detectors and columns representing fluorochromes.
}}
}
\value{
A symmetric numeric matrix of cosine similarity values between fluorochromes.
The matrix has fluorochrome names as both row and column names.
}
\description{
This function computes the pairwise cosine similarity between fluorochrome spectral profiles
based on a user-defined matrix of detector responses. It extracts a submatrix from the full
spectral matrix using specified detectors and fluorochromes, and returns a symmetric similarity
matrix where each entry represents the cosine similarity between two fluorochromes.
