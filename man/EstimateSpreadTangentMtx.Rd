\title{Estimate Tangent Matrix of Slope Components in USERM}
\usage{
EstimateSpreadTangentMtx(Userm)
}
\arguments{
\item{Userm}{A list containing USERM analysis results. Must include:
\itemize{
\item \code{detectors}: A character vector of detector names.
\item \code{fluors}: A character vector of fluorochrome names.
\item \code{A}: A system matrix mapping detectors to fluorochromes.
\item \code{Res}: A named list of result objects for each fluorochrome, each containing \code{slopMtx}.
}}
}
\value{
A square numeric matrix with fluorochrome names as both row and column names.
Each entry represents the diagonalized slope component projected through the pseudo-inverse
of the system matrix.
}
\description{
This function computes a tangent matrix representing the diagonalized slope components
of signal spread across fluorochromes, based on the system matrix and slope matrices
from the USERM result object.
}
\details{
The function uses the pseudo-inverse of the system matrix \code{A} to transform
slope matrices from detector space to fluorochrome space. The diagonal elements of the
transformed matrices are extracted and assembled into the final tangent matrix.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  tangent_mtx <- EstimateSpreadTangentMtx(Userm)
  print(tangent_mtx)
}
