\title{Launch an interactive Shiny app to explore predicted spread}
\usage{
PredOneSpread(Userm, population_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{Userm}{A userm object created by \code{\link{CreateUserm}}, containing unmixing matrix, detector and fluor information, and intensity data.}

\item{population_id}{A character string specifying the column name in \code{Userm$Intensity_mtx} representing the population to be visualized.}
}
\value{
A Shiny UI object that can be passed to \code{shinyApp()} or used within a Shiny server function.
}
\description{
This function launches a Shiny application that allows users to interactively explore the predicted spread
of unmixed signals based on a given userm object (\code{Userm}) and a selected population.
The app provides multiple tabs for visualizing the unmixing matrix, prediction plots, slope and intercept matrices,
and exporting results.
}
\details{
The app includes the following features:
\itemize{
\item Fluor and detector selection panels
\item Interactive prediction plot with scale and axis controls
\item Visualization of unmixing, pseudoinverse, slope, and intercept matrices
\item Export options for HTML reports and NxN/Nx1 plots
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
PredOneSpread(Userm, population_id = "P1")
}
