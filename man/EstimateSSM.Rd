\title{Estimate Spillover Spreading Matrix (SSM) from Unmixing and Control Data}
\usage{
EstimateSSM(
  SSM_fluor,
  A,
  Userm,
  custom_ssm_dir = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE,
  mSS = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SSM_fluor}{A character vector of fluorophore names to include in the SSM. Each must have a corresponding \code{SSMObj_*.rds} file.}

\item{A}{A numeric unmixing matrix (detectors × fluorophores) with row names as detector channels and column names as fluorophores.}

\item{custom_ssm_dir}{Optional path to a directory containing custom \code{SSMObj_*.rds} files. If \code{NULL}, only built-in files from the \code{USERM} package are used.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of spillover spreading scores, with rows and columns named by \code{SSM_fluor}.
Each entry \code{ssm[i, j]} represents the spreading from fluorophore \code{i} into fluorophore \code{j}.
Diagonal entries are set to 0.
}
\description{
Computes a full Spillover Spreading Matrix (SSM) for a set of fluorophores using precomputed
positive/negative control data and an unmixing matrix. This matrix quantifies the extent of signal
spreading from each fluorophore into others, aiding in panel design and instrument evaluation
in spectral flow cytometry.
}
\details{
For each fluorophore in \code{SSM_fluor}, the function loads its corresponding SSM object containing
positive and negative control data. It performs detector-to-fluorophore unmixing using the pseudoinverse
of matrix \code{A}, then calculates quantile-based spread metrics for each fluorophore pair.

The spillover spreading score is computed as:
\deqn{SS = \sqrt{(S_{\sigma}^2 - R_{\sigma}^2) / \Delta F}}
where \eqn{S_{\sigma}} and \eqn{R_{\sigma}} are the 84th–50th percentile spreads in positive and negative samples,
and \eqn{\Delta F} is the median signal increase in the primary fluorophore.

If \eqn{\Delta F = 0}, the score is set to \code{NA}. Negative intermediate values yield imaginary scores,
which are returned as negative square roots.
